# 4. Explain to each other what do you see and what it means.

# 1) The values 0.52 (Water) and 0.54 (Grass) indicate a moderate positive correlation between the 'Attack' and 'Defense' stats in both types of Pokémon.
# 2) This suggests that as the 'Attack' stat increases, the 'Defense' stat tends to increase as well, and vice versa, for both Water and Grass-type Pokémon.
# 3) The similarity in the correlation values means that the relationship between 'Attack' and 'Defense' is somewhat consistent across these two types, with a slightly stronger correlation in Grass-type Pokémon. Could hint that this is a universal relationship for all types of Pokemon.
